Installation
------------

ChemDB requires a working installation of php5 and has been tested with the
apache2 webserver. The chemdb folder should be placed in the web content
directory of the web server.

You will need to edit configuration files to initially set up the application.

In chemdb/app/config/config.php, set

    $config['base_url'] = 'http://localhost/path/to/chemdb/'

In chemdb/app/config/database.php, set the hostname, username, password and 
database name for your SQL server. The default SQL server is mysql. If you use
a different database you will need to change $db['default']['dbdriver'] to the
appropriate value according to the Doctrine 1.x documentation, located at:
http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine1/en/latest/en/index.html

TODO: describe creating the database

ChemDB uses encrypted sessions. You will need to set a unique encryption key.
In chemdb/app/config/config.php, set $config['encryption_key'] to a 32
character passphrase/key containing numbers and upper- and lower-case letters.
There are various ways to generate random passwords. Feel free to use whatever
method you like.
